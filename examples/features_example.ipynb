    "## 1. What is a feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "Features are instances of the abstract class `Feature` and are responsible for creating and altering images. For example, a feature might add a particle or add some salt-and-pepper noise to an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "All features operate on lists of images. Most features, such as noise, apply some tranformation to all images in the list. This transformation can be additive, such as adding some Gaussian noise or a background illumination, or non-additive, such as introducing Poisson noise or performing a low-pass filter. This transformation is defined by the method `get(image, **kwargs)`, which all implementations of the class `Feature` need to define.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some features, for example scattterers, instead, append a new image to the list. This behavior is controlled by the class attributes `__distributed__` and `__list_merge_strategy__`:\n",
    "* `__distributed__` controls whether `.get(image, **kwargs)` is called on each element in the list separately (`__distributed__ = True`), or it is called on the list as a whole (`__distributed__ = False`).  \n",
    "* `__list_merge_strategy__` controls how the output of `.get(image, **kwargs)` is merged with the input list. It can be `MERGE_STRATEGY_OVERRIDE` (0, default), where the new list is output without merging with the input, or `MERGE_STRATEGY_APPEND` (1), where the new list is appended to the end of the input list.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a feature is created, keyword arguments can be passed to its constructor. These arguments are stored as properties (as a `PropertyDict`) of the feature (see also [properties_example](properties_example.ipynb)), which determine how the feature is resolved. When a feature is updated using the method `.update()`, all properties are updated by calling their respective methods `.update()`. When a feature is resolved using the method `resolve(image)`, the current values of all properties are sent through the method `get(image, **kwargs)` as keyword arguments."
