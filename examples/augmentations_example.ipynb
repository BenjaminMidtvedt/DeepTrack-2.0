    "Augmentations are instances of the abstract class `Feature` and serve to decrease the average simulation time by altering the input image several times before performing additional expensive computation. For example, `FlipDiagonal` is an augmentation that returns both the input image and the transposed image before recomputing the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "All augmentations take a parent feature as their first input, and two keyword arguments, `load_size` and `updates_per_reload`. When an augmentation is initialized, it resolves `load_size` number of images from the parent, and stores them. When an augmentation in updated, it loads one of these images, sampled randomly. When the augmentation has been resolved `updated_per_resolve` number of times, it resolves a new set of images from its parent feature. When the augmentation is resolved, it alters the loaded image using the method `.get()`.  \n",
    "\n",
